    be changed across 
    we should treat

(* How we destruct the immutable block 
   depend on the block name itself, 
   good hints to do aggressive destructing
   1. the variable is not exported
      like [matched] -- these are blocks constructed temporary
   2. how the variable is used 
      if it is guarateed to be 
   - non export 
   - and non escaped (there is no place it is used as a whole)
      then we can always destruct it 
      if some fields are used in multiple places, we can create 
      a temporary field 

   3. It would be nice that when the block is mutable, its 
       mutable fields are explicit, since wen can not inline an mutable block access
