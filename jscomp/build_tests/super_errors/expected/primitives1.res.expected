  1 [2mâ”‚[0m /* got float, wanted int */
  [1;31m2[0m [2mâ”‚[0m [1;31m2.[0m + 2
  3 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mfloat[0m
  Somewhere wanted: [1;33mint[0m
  
  You can convert [1;33mfloat[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mBelt.Float.toInt[0m.
  If this is a literal, try a number without a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20[0m).
