  [1;33msomeUnknownField[0m refers to a record field, but no corresponding record type is in scope.
  
  If it's defined in another module or file, bring it into scope by:
  - Prefixing the field name with the module name: [1;33mTheModule.someUnknownField[0m
  - Or specifying the record type explicitly:
  [1;33mlet theValue: TheModule.theType = {someUnknownField: VALUE}[0m
