/***
    This module  provides a type `Lazy.t` and functions to create and

    computed until it is needed.  This is useful for deferring
    computations that may be expensive or unnecessary.

    The type of a lazy value.  `Lazy.t<'a>` represents a lazy value
    that will eventually yield a value of type `'a` when accessed.
    The value is computed only once, and the result is cached for
    subsequent accesses.  If the computation raises an exception,
    the same exception is raised again on subsequent accesses.
