  8 [2mâ”‚[0m   }
  9 [2mâ”‚[0m }

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33munit[0m

  - Did you mean to assign this to a variable?
  - If you don't care about the result of this expression, you can assign it to [1;33m_[0m via [1;33mlet _ = ...[0m or pipe it to [1;33mignore[0m via [1;33mexpression->ignore[0m
