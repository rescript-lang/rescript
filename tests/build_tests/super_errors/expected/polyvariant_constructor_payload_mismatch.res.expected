  2 [2mâ”‚[0m type test2 = [#Click(string)]
  3 [2mâ”‚[0m let a: test = #Click(1)

  5 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mtest[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mtest2[0m
  
  Both polymorphic variants have the constructor [1;33m#Click[0m, but their payload types are incompatible.
  Make sure the payload types for [1;33m#Click[0m match exactly in both polymorphic variants.
  
  You can convert [1;33mint[0m to [1;33mstring[0m with [1;33mInt.toString[0m.
