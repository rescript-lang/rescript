  Cannot use %typeof on this value, because its type is not fully known yet.

%typeof needs a value whose type is completely determined at this point.
For example, [] or ref([]) don't say what element type they hold yet.

How to fix:
- Add a type annotation to the value (e.g. let u: array<int> = [];).
- Or define the value in a way that makes its type known immediately.

Note: This is related to the value restriction (non-generalizable type variables).
