  This has type: [1;31moption<'a>[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mReact.element[0m [2m(defined as[0m [1;33mJsx.element[0m[2m)[0m
  
  You need to unwrap this option to its underlying value first, then turn that value into a JSX element.
  For [1;33mNone[0m, you can use [1;33mReact.null[0m to output nothing into JSX.
