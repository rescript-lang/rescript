  [1;31m11[0m [2mâ”‚[0m   let _ = doStuff(~[1;31mctx[0m)

  This has type: [1;31m{"multiply": (string, string) => string}[0m
  But this function argument [1;33m~ctx[0m is expecting:
    [1;33m{.."multiply": (int, int) => int}[0m
  
  Types for field [1;33m"multiply"[0m are incompatible:
  Field [1;33m"multiply"[0m in the passed object has type [1;31m(string, string) => string[0m, but is expected to have type [1;33m(int, int) => int[0m.
  
  You can convert [1;33mstring[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mInt.fromString[0m.
