  Type x is not a subtype of y 

  The record [1;33mx[0m cannot be coerced to the record [1;33my[0m because:
  - Field [1;33mx[0m runtime representation is [1;33m"x"[0m in record [1;33my[0m, but in record [1;33mx[0m it is configured to be [1;33m"z"[0m (via the @as attribute). Runtime representations must match.
