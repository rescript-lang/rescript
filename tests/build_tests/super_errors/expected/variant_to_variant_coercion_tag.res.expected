  Type x is not a subtype of y 

  The variants have different [1;33m@tag[0m configurations.
  - [1;33mx[0m has tag [1;33mkind[0m.
  - [1;33my[0m has no explicit tag.
  
  Fix this by making sure the variants either have the exact same [1;33m@tag[0m configuration, or no [1;33m@tag[0m at all.
