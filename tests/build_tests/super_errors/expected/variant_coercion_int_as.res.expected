  Type x is not a subtype of int 

  The constructor [1;33mTwo[0m of variant [1;33mx[0m has no [1;33m@as[0m payload, which makes it a [1;33mstring[0m at runtime.
  That runtime representation is not compatible with the expected runtime representation of [1;33mint[0m.
  
  Fix this by making sure all constructors in variant [1;33mx[0m has a runtime representation of [1;33mint[0m.
