  This has type: [1;31moption<float>[0m
  But the component prop [1;33msomeOpt[0m is expected to have type: [1;33mfloat[0m
  
  [1;33msomeOpt[0m is an optional component prop, and you're passing an optional value to it.
  Values passed to an optional component prop don't need to be wrapped in an option. You might need to adjust the type of the value supplied.
       
  Possible solutions: 
  - Unwrap the option from the value you're passing in
  - If you really do want to pass the optional value, prepend the value with [1;33m?[0m to show you want to pass the option, like: [1;33msomeOpt=?o[0m
