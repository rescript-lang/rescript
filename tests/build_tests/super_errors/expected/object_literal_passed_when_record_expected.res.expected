  [1;31m4[0m [2mâ”‚[0m let x: xx = [[1;31m{"one": true}[0m]
  5 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31m{"one": bool}[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mx[0m
  
  You're passing a [1;31mReScript object[0m where a [1;33mrecord[0m is expected. Objects are written with quoted keys, and records with unquoted keys.
  
  Possible solutions: 
  - Rewrite the object to a record, like: [1;33m{one: true}[0m
