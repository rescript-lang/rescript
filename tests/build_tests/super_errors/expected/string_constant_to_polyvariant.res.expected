  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But this function argument is expecting: [1;33m[#ONE | #TWO][0m

  Possible solutions:
  - The constant passed matches one of the expected polymorphic variant constructors. Did you mean to pass this as a polymorphic variant? If so, rewrite [1;33m"ONE"[0m to [1;33m#ONE
