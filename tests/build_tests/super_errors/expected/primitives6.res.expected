  1 [2mâ”‚[0m /* Wrong constructor argument */
  2 [2mâ”‚[0m type x = X(int, float)
  [1;31m3[0m [2mâ”‚[0m X(10, [1;31m10[0m)->ignore
  4 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mfloat[0m
  
  Possible solutions: 
  - These types are compatible at runtime. You can use the coercion operator [1;33m:>[0m to convert to the expected type [1;33mfloat[0m.
    If you want to use coercion, rewrite the highlighted code to: [1;33m(10 :> float)
[0m
  
  
  You can convert [1;33mint[0m to [1;33mfloat[0m with [1;33mInt.toFloat[0m.
  If this is a literal, try a number with a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20.[0m).
