  This pattern matches values of type [1;31moption<'a>[0m
  but a pattern was expected which matches values of type [1;33mint[0m
  
  You're expecting the value you're pattern matching on to be an [1;33moption[0m, but the value is actually not an option.
  Change your pattern match to work on the concrete value (remove [1;31mSome(_)[0m or [1;31mNone[0m from the pattern) to make it work.
