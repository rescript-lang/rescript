  This has type: [1;31m[> #One][0m
  But this function argument is expecting: [1;33mvariant[0m

  The type expected is a variant (not polymorphic variant). The expected variant has a constructor named [1;33mOne[0m, did you mean to use that?

Possible solutions:
  - Change the code to use the variant constructor, like: [1;33mOne
