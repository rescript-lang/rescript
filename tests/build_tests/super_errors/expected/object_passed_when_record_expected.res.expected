  This has type: [1;31m{"one": bool}[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mx[0m

  You're passing a [1;31mReScript object[0m where a [1;33mrecord[0m is expected. 

  - Did you mean to pass a record instead of an object? Objects are written with quoted keys, and records with unquoted keys. Remove the quotes from the object keys to pass it as a record instead of object.
