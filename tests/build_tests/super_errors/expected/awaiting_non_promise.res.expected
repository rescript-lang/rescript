  4 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But you're using [1;33mawait[0m on this expression, so it is expected to be of type:
    [1;33mpromise<'a>[0m

  You're trying to await something that is not a promise.

Possible solutions:
  - Remove the [1;33mawait[0m if this is not expected to be a promise
  - Wrap the expression in [1;33mPromise.resolve[0m to convert the expression to a promise
