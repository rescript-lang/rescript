  This use of an inlined record is not allowed: its anonymous type would escape its constructor scope.
  Possible solutions: 
  - Destructure the fields you're interested in from the inline record
  - Change the underlying type to use a defined record as payload instead of an inline record. That will let you use the payload without destructuring it first
