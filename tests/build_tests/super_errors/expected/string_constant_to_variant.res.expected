  This has type: [1;31mstring[0m
  But this function argument is expecting: [1;33mstatus[0m

  Possible solutions:
  - The constant passed matches the runtime representation of one of the expected variant constructors. Did you mean to pass this as a variant constructor? If so, rewrite [1;33m"Active"[0m to [1;33mActive
