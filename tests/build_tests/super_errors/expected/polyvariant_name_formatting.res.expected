  This pattern matches values of type [1;31m[? #Invalid][0m
  but a pattern was expected which matches values of type [1;33mpolyvariant[0m
  
  The second polymorphic variant is [1;33mclosed[0m and doesn't include the constructor: [1;31m#Invalid[0m.
  
  Possible solutions:
  - Either make the second variant [1;33mopen[0m so it can accept additional constructors. To do this, make sure the type starts with [1;33m[>[0m instead of [1;33m[[0m
  - Or add the missing constructor to it.
