  1 [2mâ”‚[0m /* got float, wanted int */
  [1;31m2[0m [2mâ”‚[0m 2. + [1;31m2[0m
  3 [2mâ”‚[0m 

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mfloat[0m
  
  You can convert [1;33mint[0m to [1;33mfloat[0m with [1;33mBelt.Int.toFloat[0m.
  If this is a literal, try a number with a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20.[0m).
