  2 [2mâ”‚[0m let numbers: array<int> = [1, 2, 3]

  [1;31m4[0m [2mâ”‚[0m   let y: string = [1;31mx[0m
  5 [2mâ”‚[0m   Js.log(y)
  6 [2mâ”‚[0m }

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mstring[0m
  
  You can convert [1;33mint[0m to [1;33mstring[0m with [1;33mInt.toString[0m.
