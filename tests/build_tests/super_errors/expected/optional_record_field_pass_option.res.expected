  This has type: [1;31moption<bool>[0m
  But the record field [1;33mtest[0m is expected to have type: [1;33mbool[0m
  
  [1;33mtest[0m is an optional record field, and you're passing an optional value to it.
  Optional fields expect you to pass a non-optional value.
       
  Possible solutions: 
  - Unwrap the option and pass a concrete value directly
  - If you really do want to pass the optional value, prepend the value with [1;33m?[0m to show you want to pass the option, like: [1;33m{test: ?t[0m}
