  [36m/.../fixtures/jsx_invalid_return_type_component_with_props.res[0m

  This has type: [1;31mint[0m
  But it's expected to have type: [1;33mReact.element[0m [2m(defined as[0m [1;33mJsx.element[0m[2m)[0m
  
  In JSX, all content must be JSX elements. You can convert int to a JSX element with [1;33mReact.int[0m.
