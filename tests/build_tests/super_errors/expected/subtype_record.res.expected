  This has type: [1;31msomeOtherType[0m
  But this function argument is expecting: [1;33mSomeModule.someType[0m
  
  Possible solutions: 
  - These types are compatible at runtime. You can use the coercion operator [1;33m:>[0m to convert to the expected type [1;33mSomeModule.someType[0m.
    If you want to use coercion, rewrite the highlighted code to: [1;33m(v :> SomeModule.someType)
